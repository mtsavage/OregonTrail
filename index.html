                        Thousands of people voluntarily uprooted their lives to cross the vast and uncharted west to travel to
                        the Oregon Territory. This great migration was known as the Oregon Trail. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="margin-left:300px;margin-right:300px"> The Oregon Trail was not an easy venture, nor was it a journey for the faint of heart.
                        It was a long strenuous trek which claimed the lives of many who set out west. This is known
                        by the many firsthand accounts written by those travelers, through these accounts it is easy to
                        obtain a vivid picture of what that journey was like. </p>

                <p>This particular story is about a party made of four families, the Akin, Booth, Ingram, and Ritchey families.
                    In 1852 they decided to make the large move from Salem, Iowa to Portland, Oregon taking the Oregon Emigrant
                    trail. In total the party was made up of 39 people, 10 adults and 29 children, the children ranging from age
                    nineteen to infancy. A party of this size, especially one of such a large age range, was not an easy move.
                    There were an abundance of hardships and trials that these families faced.  </p>

                <img class="img-responsive img-border=10px img-left" src="img/Family2.jpg" alt="Emigrant Family">
                <br>
                <p>James Akin, Jr., who was 19 years old when his family set off for the Oregon Trail, was the eldest of the children.
                    He kept a journal where he nearly entered their progress and any major events they encountered on the trail nearly everyday.
                    Each entry was short and to the point, but it still gave a good outline of the family's journey and struggles. </p>
                <p>He starts his diary on Thursday, April 15, 1852 when the party leaves their old home, Salem, Iowa. For the first couple
                    days he comments on the weather,  that the roads are good, that they crossed a creek, and that their wood supply is good.  </p>

                <img class="img-responsive img-border img-left" src="img/Fording_River.jpg" alt="Emigrant Family">
                <br>
                <p>Crossing rivers and streams was common along the Oregon Trail. Many times throughout the diary,
                    Akins speaks of how the party forded a river, took a ferry, or a toll bridge across. Crossing rivers,
                    however, did lead to several mishaps to many emigrants. For instance, on May 7th, Akins reported that
                    a boat sank on the Nishnabotna River. Additionally, as the party approached the Missouri river, Akins
                    mentions that one man in a different party drowned on May 11th from a ferry flipping over. He mentions
                    again that a boat sinks on May 14th.</p>

                <p>To sustain themselves for the whole journey, they had to use what they could long the way, so hunting
                    and gathering was a regular part of their routine. Akins reports that on June 7th the party hunted
                    for antelope. They also collected Buffalo chips (dried buffalo dung) to use for fire fuel.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Sickness was the greatest hardship and killer which took the lives of many emigrants, including
                    those in this party. On June 14th, as the party approached two major landmarks on the trail,
                    Chimney rock and Scotts bluff, where they stopped to camp because of the sickness of a party member.
                    On June 16th,the first life is claimed on the trail as Louisa Ritchey, wife of Stuart Ritchey, dies of cholera
                    at the age of 29.  </p>

                <br>
                <p>Hardships continue on the trail as once again sickness makes its rounds among the company. Another
                    death occurs on June 23st, as the Elva Ingram, young daughter of James and Ritta Ingram, dies.
                    The party continues, but hardship still continues as the party goes without water for several miles.
                    They finally run into the Platte River, where they can quench their thirst, but resources still run
                    low as they cannot find grass for the cattle. They find themselves in a wood shortage as well
                    until they pass more timber and grass filled areas on June 28th.  </p>

                <p>The Oregon Trail did not lack in natural beauty. Along the way were an abundance of amazing scenery
                    and iconic natural features. On July 2nd the company passed two of these features, Independence Rock
                    and Devil Gate. </p>

                <p>The trek continues as the company passes over summits of Rocky Mountains on July 10th through the
                    South Pass. The climb is gradual, and Akins comments on the pleasant weather and good roads. </p>

                <p>The party is coming closer and closer to their goal as the Idaho boarder quickly approaches. Nearing
                    the Idaho Line in late July. They have to go over the more rugged summit of the Bear Mountains which
                    Akins describes as rough and hilly. A week later, however, the company becomes sick again, and one
                    of the children of Caleb and Alice Ritchey, Miranda Ritchey, passes away on July 31st.</p>

                <br>
                <p>On August 8th, Akins reports that they had gone without water for over 13 miles as they travel dusty
                    roads with dead cattle scattered through the landscape. The hot, dry trek goes on, the party even
                    travels at night more often than day to avoid the heat. On August 14th, they come across some
                    Native Americans and they trade tea and salt for fresh salmon. Fresh food at this point in the journey was
                    more scarce and therefore highly valued. </p>

                    The last leg involves rafting down the Columbia river. This endeavor of making their own raft takes
                    a lot of preparation. Akins states that they “cut logs and cork wagon beds water tight all day” (55).
                    They continue with their rafting preparations for several days, and then they take off on it on
                    October 6th.  Even after the raft is in the water, they have to take it out to make modifications on
                    October 11th. </p>

                    and ragged they finish their journey of nearly 2,000 miles in a timespan of six months. All families
                    are able to make Donation Land Claims in the Willamette Valley. The story of the long journey of the
                    Akin, Booth, Ingram, and Ritchey families ends there.

                    <p> The Oregon Trail was the largest known voluntary migration in history. This story map
                        depicts the journey of four families, the Akin, Booth, Ingram, and Ritchey families. In 1852
                        they decided to make the large move from Salem, Iowa to Portland, Oregon taking the Oregon
                        Emigrant trail. The story of these families was recoded in diary of James Akin, Jr., who was 19
                        and the eldest of the children. In this journal, he entered their progress and any major events
                        they encountered on the trail. </p>
